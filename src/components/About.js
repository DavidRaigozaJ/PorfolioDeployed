            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a design engineering graduate from EAFIT University in Medellin, where I gained a deep appreciation for the intersection of art and technology. 
            After graduation, I founded and successfully grew a jewelry brand that won several design awards.
             Seeking to deepen my knowledge and skills, I pursued a Masters's degree in Arts from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia,
            where I explored the role of symbols in society.
            In 2016, I was introduced to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain through an art project I was working on.
            I was inspired by the potential for blockchain technology to transform traditional monetary systems and started building my own Ethereum node. Using ERC20,
            I created a Colombia crypto peso as an art piece that represented the idea that money is not only a functional tool,
            but also a collectible item. 
            I discovered that code can be written into art and that blockchain technology offers a new way to approach art and finance.
            Currently, I lead an investment club with my friends, where we focus on investing in disruptive technologies. 
            We also run a startup jewelry business that uses rapid prototyping and precious metals casting. 
            I am particularly interested in the relationship between physical products and NFTs in the context of the internet of things.
            My value proposition lies in my unique blend of creativity and technical knowledge, as well as my ability to connect diverse concepts and apply them to the blockchain world.
            I am eager to continue exploring the potential of blockchain technology and contribute to its development in innovative ways.
